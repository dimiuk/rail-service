                    Rail transport (also known as train transport) is a means of 
                    transferring passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on 
                    rails, which are located on tracks. In contrast to road transport,
                    where the vehicles run on a prepared flat surface, rail vehicles 
                    (rolling stock) are directionally guided by the tracks on which
                    they run. Tracks usually consist of steel rails, installed on 
                    sleepers (ties) set in ballast, on which the rolling stock, 
                    usually fitted with metal wheels, moves. Other variations are also 
                    possible, such as "slab track", in which the rails are fastened 
                    to a concrete foundation resting on a prepared subsurface.

                    As a result of strict precautionary measures and a reduced number 
                    of trains in operation since March 2020, rail transport reduced 
                    significantly in the EU. Freight transport was impacted by those 
                    restrictions to a much lesser extent than passenger transport, 
                    which almost halved between 2019 and 2020 (-46%) reaching 223 billion 
                    passenger-kilometres. Particularly significant were the drops in the
                    second and the fourth quarter of 2020 (-74% and -54% compared with 
                    the same period of 2019).
